## Infomation of dataset:

The Tmall dataset is obtained from https://github.com/wtw666/Representation-Learning-for-Predicting-Customer-Orders.



Due to GitHub's file upload size restrictions, we have uploaded a compressed version of the Tmall dataset. Upon decompression **Tmall.7z**, you will obtain **Tmall.txt**, which is the original dataset with the following internal structure:
```
43,652,112
1,371,295

66,30
66,535,4,192
43,62,186,268,206,9,15
35,14,82,48,47,36
...
```
**Tmall.7z** and **Tmall.zip**: the compressed file of **Tmall.txt** by 7-zip with LZMA and Deflate.


To apply the HKTVmall data: https://opendatabank.hktvmall.com/portal/register. If you get the access right, email the author of this paper, we will give you the clean dataset we used in the experiment.
